        <h2>Deep Learning Based Motion Assistance System</h2>
        <p class="p3">After trying and optimizing, the design of the motion assistance system was finally completed. Bone binding during movement, i.e., 
            visualization of bones, was achieved. It is also able to make the function of posture recognition, including the ability of error 
            correction and judging the degree of posture standard. The system adopts OPENPOSE-BODY_25 as the core algorithm (with an accuracy rate close to 99%),
            and its usability is much higher than that of OPENPOSE-COCO18 (with an accuracy rate of only 39.8%), and for BLAZEPOSE, no successful model has 
            been obtained for the time being. In the era of national fitness, the research of exercise assistance system will surely become a craze. 
            The process of research is the process of efficient learning, and the process of trying to train immature models, as well as making timely 
            adjustments to deploy mature models, is both a renewed cognition and learning of artificial intelligence and an exercise in thinking judgment.
