        <h2>The Subtletization of Marriage and Mourning Customs in Shanghai</h2>
        <p class="p3">The subtletization of marriage and mourning customs in Shanghai reflects the city's unique fusion of traditional Chinese values and modern urban culture.
            As a cosmopolitan hub, Shanghai has seen its traditional customs evolve in response to globalization, social progress, 
            and the influence of Western values. For marriage customs, traditional practices such as betrothal gifts and complex 
            wedding rituals are often simplified, focusing on personal expression and the coupleâ€™s preferences. While traditional symbols like the color red, 
            representing good fortune, remain, there is greater flexibility in venue choices, ceremony styles, and attire, often blending Western white wedding 
            dresses with traditional Chinese elements.
